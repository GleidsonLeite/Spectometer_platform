# Spectometer_platform

This project was developed to control a Spectometer Platform using 4 28BYJ48, 1 A4988 driver motor, VL53L0X sensors and Pull up buttons using Arduino MEGA 2560.

To use this project you should use Platformio to build and upload the code to your microcontroller.

In the future this project will be modified to use Serial communication to control the platform.
